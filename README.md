# Boo: My Haunted House

Analogous to Angry Birds, our iOS game starts with an in fact very cute Halloween scene. 

Players can throw Candy/Banana/Milk at pumpkins and ghosts surrounded by woods. 

Players enter the next level after they destroy all the pumpkins and ghosts within a given number of items; otherwise, they can re-try a level.
